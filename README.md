# "Reverse Pac-Man"
## Our almost finals

Reverse Pac-Man, code name 'ManPac', product name 'Maze Daiva'.  
In this game you're playing as the ghosts instead. You can switch between which ghost you're controlling by pressing tab, and navigating around the playing field using the arrow-keys or 'wasd'.  
The goal is to stop Diva - in the place of PacMan - from eating all the circuit boards. You can do this by hitting them 3 times. But don't be too quick, cause when Diva eats a usb-stick instead of a normal circuit-board they go into hunting mode.
